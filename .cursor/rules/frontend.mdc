# Frontend code guidelines
The frontend is located at ./frontend, it's a React SPA

## Tech Stack
- PNPM for package management
- shadcn/ui component library
- tailwind for CSS
- tanstack router for routes
- tankstack query for data fetching
- Kubb for auto-generating client from the API's openapi spec. this autogenerates Tanstack Query queries
- deployed in vercel

## Design guidelines
The design of the app aims to be minimalistic and simple, the idea is to avoid unnecessary clutter.

## Code guidelines
- Always use the kubb generated client for communicating with the backend.
- Always use proper typescript types in your components.
- Always try to use a shadcn/ui component if it can be used instead of creating a component from scratch.
- Don't try to add components to components/ui. These are only meant to be added by the shadcn cli.
- When doing logic with business classes, utilize cn from [utils.ts](mdc:frontend/src/lib/utils.ts). Avoid using string concatenation or templated strings
    unless it's something really simple.
